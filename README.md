# publication-scripts-bcri

In support of open research: a repo containing the analysis scripts used in Digby et al. (submitted), *The impact of uncertainty in black carbon's refractive index on simulated optical depth and radiative forcing*

**Contents:**

* **`composite_paperfigs.py:`** The main analysis script.  Contains two main functions: `composite_maps_ts()` used to create figures 1 and 2, and `composite_temp()` used to create figure 3.
* **`utilties.py:`** Contains scripts for reading in data and calculating forcings. Contains a certain amount of pseudocode to maintain anonymity (just in terms of data paths).
